## 🌐 Deployment

This repo does not include a platform-specific deployment config (for example, no `netlify.toml`).

Build and run from the `final/` directory and set the required Cloudinary env vars:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER_NAME`

## 🎨 Cloudinary Features

This project demonstrates several Cloudinary capabilities:

- **Automatic Image Optimization**: Format and quality optimization
- **Smart Cropping**: Automatic gravity-based cropping (`gravity: 'auto'`)
- **Overlays**: Logo watermarking on product images
- **Dynamic Transformations**: Discount badges and text overlays
- **Responsive Images**: Automatic sizing and format selection

## 📝 Available Scripts

Run these scripts from `start/` or `final/`.

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production with Turbopack
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🔍 Key Files

- `final/app/page.tsx` - Home page with product listing
- `final/app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual product detail page
- `final/components/ProductImage.tsx` - Cloudinary image component with transformations
- `final/components/ImageModal.tsx` - Modal window
- `final/ColorSelector.tsx` - Color picker with AI integration
- `final/lib/cloudinary.ts` - Cloudinary SDK configuration
- `final/next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration (Server Actions body size limit)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Product pages show server error on your deployment platform

The app reads `products/products.json` from `process.cwd()`. If you still encounter issues:

1. Verify your build/run working directory is `final/`
2. Verify the deployed files include `final/products/products.json`

### Cloudinary images not loading

1. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
2. Check that the upload preset exists in your Cloudinary dashboard
3. Ensure product images are uploaded to the correct folder in Cloudinary
4. Run `npm run init` to upload the logo if it's missing

### Build fails on your deployment platform

1. Check that all required environment variables are set
2. Ensure the build/run working directory is `final/`
3. Ensure Node.js version is 20+ in your build settings
